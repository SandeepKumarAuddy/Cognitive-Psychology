# What is Deduction?
---

A deduction is a conclusion that follows from things we believe or assume.

For example, you meet Sue, who tells you that Mary is her mother. You immediately infer that Sue is Mary’s daughter, although that is not the fact that was presented to you. This means that you must carry around rules such as If x is the mother of y and y is female, then y is the daughter of x

It is not that you are conscious of this rule or of applying it to make this deduction but it must be there in some form in your brain, together with some mechanism for applying it to facts and observations.

Deduction has obvious benefits for human beings.
- **Our memories are limited** and our brains can only store so many beliefs about the world. However, if we also hold a number of general rules, then these can be applied to draw out implications as and when they are required.
- Deduction is also involved in **hypothetical thinking** when we ask "What IF?" questions.

Example: Scientific theories take the form of rules, often formalised with mathematics.

#### Logic in Deduction

- For deduction to be useful, it needs to be accurate.
- This has been recognised in the discipline of philosophy for centuries. Philosophers devised systems of logic, whose purpose is to ensure accurate deduction.
- A logically valid argument is one whose conclusion necessarily follows from its premises

#### Criteria for a Good Argument

- TERMS must be clear and unambiguous
- PROPOSITIONS / PREMISES must be true
- ARGUMENT must be logically valid (i.e., conclusion must follow from premises)

#### Paradigms in Reasoning

- There is a tradition in philosophy that logic is the basis for rational thought (Henle, 1962; Wason & Johnson-Laird, 1972). This view held a powerful influence on psychology during the second half of the twentieth century and was responsible for a major method of studying human reasoning, which I will call the **deduction paradigm** (Evans, 2002).
	- Huge numbers of experiments were run with this paradigm and I will try to summarise their main findings in this chapter.
	- While many important things were learnt about the nature of human thinking and reasoning, a lot of **psychologists eventually lost faith in the importance of logic for rational thinking**.
- In recent years, this has a led many to revise their methods and adopt what is called the **new paradigm** psychology of reasoning.

#### Deductive Paradigm

- The deduction paradigm tests whether **people untrained in logic** can **make valid inferences**.
- The idea behind this is that:
	- If logic is the basis for rationality in everyday thinking
	- then, **everyone** should comply with it, not just those who have taken logic classes.
- Therefore, there are some conditions to follow in this method.
	1. Exclude participants with formal training.
	2. Present them with some *premises (assumptions)*, from which a *logical deduction* can be made.
		- Often a *conclusion* is also given and people are asked whether it follows or not.
		- Two other instructions are usually given:
			- (1) assume that the premises given are true and
			- (2) only make or endorse a conclusion which necessarily follows from them.
		- Given these instructions, only the form of the argument should matter, not the content.
		- **For example**, *people should always agree that Modus Ponens and disjunction elimination are valid arguments, no matter what we substitute for x and y in the rules given above*. By this means, the paradigm assesses whether or not people are logical in their deductive reasoning.

# Main Methods and Findings of Deduction Paradigm
---

- Intensive study occured from the 1960s onwards.
- People were observed to make **frequent logical errors**, to show **systematic biases**, and to be **influenced by their beliefs about the content of the premises and conclusions**
- All of these findings have been replicated many times since using three major methods, or sub-paradigms:
	1. Syllogistic Reasoning
	2. Conditional Inference
	3. Wason Selection Task

## (1) Syllogistic Reasoning
---

- One of the most ancient systems of logic, devised by *Aristotle*.
- A syllogism involves 2 promises and 3 terms (A, B, C)
- There can be different **models** for the relation between any two categories (say A and B)
	- ![[Pasted image 20230426235105.png]]
- The statements (premises & conclusion) in a classical premise can be in one of the **four different moods**. Most moods are ambiguous (except one) and hence can be represented by more than one models.
	- (A) All A are B
		- ambiguous, can be represented by two models:
		- **model of identity** ("All men have Y chromosomes")
		- **model of inclusion (A inside B)** ("All boys are male")
	- (E) No A are B 
		- It is unambiguous, only 1 model can represent it.
		- **model of exclusion**
	- (I) Some A are B 
		- It is highly ambiguous, can be represented by 3 models:
		- **model of overlap**
		- **model of inclusion (B inside A)**
		- **model of identity**
	- (O) Some A are not B 
		- It is highly ambiguous, can be represented by 3 models:
		- **model of overlap**
		- **model of inclusion (B inside A)**
		- **model of exclusion**
- Based on the order in which terms are arranged in a syllogistic argument, we have different **figures of syllogism**
	- ![[Pasted image 20230426235241.png]]


#### Valid Argument

For the argument to be valid, its conclusion has to be true in all models of this three-way relationship that the premises allow.

#### Fallacy

- A fallacy is an argument whose conclusion need not be true, given the premises.
- A basic finding with syllogistic reasoning is that participants endorse many fallacies.
- But these mistakes are not random – there are systematic biases in syllogistic reasoning.
- Two common types of effects are: **Atmospheric Effects** and **Belief Bias**

#### Atmospheric Effect

disposition to accept conclusions whose mood matches that of the premise.

- **Example (1):** false
	- All A are B
	- All B are C
	- Therefore, All C are A

- **Example (2):** false
	- All Alsatians are Dogs
	- All Dogs are mammals
	- Therefore, All Mammals are Dogs

- **Example (3):** true
	- All A are B
	- All B arw C
	- Therefore, Some C are A

- **OBSERVATIONS:**
	- argument (1) is a fallcy, still 77% participants said it is valid. 
	  (atmospheric effect - since conclusion and premise had the same mood)
	- This effect was not observed in argument (2) 
	  (it is observed only in case of abstract arguments)
	- The same participants who said argument-(1) to be valid, said that argument-(3) was false.
		- This is strange because:
			- Firstly, If "All C are A" is claimed True then Logically "Some C are A" should also be claimed true
			- Secondly, "Some C are A" is actually True
		- Explanation for such a bias, is that the mood of conclusion and premise is different in this case

#### Belief Bias

disposition to accept an argument as valid because the conclusion seems believable.

- **Example (4):** true
	- All Doctors have Medical Degrees
	- All College Professors are Doctors
	- Therefore, All College Proffessors have Medical Degrees.

- **Example (5):** false
	- All addictive things are inexpensive
	- Some cigarettes are inexpensive
	- Therefore, some addictive things are not cigarettes.

- **Example (6):** false
	- No millionaires are hard workers
	- Some rich people are hard workers.
	- Therefore, some millionaires are not rich people

- **OBSERVATIONS:**
	- arg-4 is logically true but many people reject it since its not realistically believable
	- arg-5 is logically false but 71% agreed the syllogism to be True
	- arg-6 is logically false but 10% agreed the syllogism to be True

- **INTERPRETATIONS:**
	- Though arg-5 and arg-6 have the same logical form and are both logically false, yet participants tend to claim arg-5 to be true more often than they do for arg-6. This is because arg-5 is realistically believable, while arg-6 is clearly not.
	- Its observed that, belief bias also occurs in case of valid arguments (arg-4), but their effect is not so strong. For valid arguments, they claimed the argment to be True for:
		- 89% if the valid argument was at the same time believable too
		- 56% if non-believable


## (3) Conditional Inference
---

- Basis of Hypothetical Reasoning
- Uses in real life:
	- Causal: "If you heat water, it will boil"
	- Prediction: "If you vote Republican, you will get your taxes cut"
	- Promise: "If you wash my car, I will give you ten dollars"
	- Tip: "If you wash Dad's car, he will give you ten dollars"
- The 3 statements are:
	- Conditional - Major Premise - assumed to be true
	- Assertion - Minor Premise - (which states that either the 1st or 2nd part of the conditional is T or F)
	- Conclusion

Four main Conditional Inferences:
![[Pasted image 20230427010631.png]]
- MP and MT are logically Valid
- DA and AC are logically Invalid

**Take an Example Conditional,** "If the Letter is B, then the number is 3"

Psychological studies show that,
- MP inference is made 100% of the time
- MT is endorsed only 60% of the time
- DA and AC though logically false, are still each endorsed 40% of the time
	- A likely reason: People are making pragmatic inferences rather than logical inferences
	- For example,
		- Arg-1: (promise)
			- "If you wash my car, I will give you ten dollars"
			- "You don't wash my car" (DA)
			- Most people will say: You will not get 10 dollars (claim DA to be valid)
			- Although logically invalid, this makes sense
		- Arg-2: (tip)
			- "If you wash Dad's car, he will give you ten dollars"
			- A tip is weaker than a promise pragmatically because the speaker suggests an action will produce a desired outcome but has no actual control over it.


## (3) Wason Selection Task
---

- Developed by ***Peter Wason*** (Father of modern psychology of reasoning)
- Known for developing several task that allowed testing of deduction theories in laboratory setting
	- The most influential of these were: "**the four-cards selection task**"
- **Tasks do not meet strict criteria of the deduction paradigm** as it involves hypothesis-testing and reasoning

#### CONFIRMATION BIAS

- **EXAMPLE-(1)** Standard Abstract Wason Selection Task
	- ![[Pasted image 20230427021228.png]]
	- **Correct Answer:**
		- Choose the A and 7 cards
		- Wason pointed out that the conditional statement can only be falsified if there is a card which has an A on one side and does not have a 3 on the other. Clearly, the A card must be turned over because it must have a 3 on the back, and if it does not, disproves the claim. Similarly, the 7 card – which is not a 3 – could have an A on the back, which would also disprove the statement. Turning the 3 is unnecessary, as it cannot disprove the rule. It need not have an A on other side.
	- **Observations:**
		- Most people choose either {A} or {A, 3}
	- **Interpretation:**
		- Wason originally suggested that they had a verification or **"confirmation bias"**. They were trying to prove the rule true rather than false, and hence **looking to find a confirming combination of A and 3**.
		- In support of this account, if you ask people to give written justifications for their choices, they typically say that **they were looking for 3 when turning the A and vice versa because this would make the rule true**
	- **Counter-argument by Evan:**
		- However, in an early research paper of my own, I showed that this account cannot be right.
		- The trick is to include a negative in the second part of the conditional.

#### MATCHING BIAS

- **EXAMPLE-(2)** Abstract Wason Selection Task with an added negation
	- ![[Pasted image 20230427022106.png]]
	- **Correct Answer:**
		- Choose cards {G, 4} as they have the potential to correctly falsify the rule.
	- **Observations:**
		- This time most people did select {G, 4}
		- Once again, participants say that they are turning the G to find a 4 and vice versa (Wason & Evans, 1975) but now in order to make it false.
	- **Interpretation:**
		- If confirmation bias (which states that, people tend to find evidences to prove a rule rather than falsify it) were true, then participants should not have chosen (4) since it has potential to disprove the rule. Yet they choosed it.
		- So this time, the bias is something different. In fact its called **"matching bias"**. People tend to choose the cards which match those named in the conditional, whether or not negations are present.
		- Matching Bias (like the atmospheric effect) operates with abstract materials

#### THEMATIC FACILITATION EFFECT

> - It was thought initially that simply using realistic materials made the problem a lot easier with higher rates of correct selections (Wason & Johnson-Laird, 1972).
> - This was known as the **thematic facilitation effect**.
> - However, it was later shown that the versions that make the task really easy include a subtle change to the logic.

- **Example-(3)** Deontic Selection Task: Drinking Age Rule
	- ![[Pasted image 20230427022923.png]]
	- **Realistic Context:**
		- People are first of all given a short context. They are asked to imagine that they are police officers enforcing rules.
		- Then the rule is given which requires "beer drinkers to be over 18 years of age".
		- Then they are given the above 4-cards selection task (one side *drink*, other side *age*)
	- **Correct Answer:**
		- Check for {"Beer", 16 years (something that is NOT "over 18")}
	- **Observations:**
		- Most people checked the "beer drinkers" and those "under 18 of years of age".
		- Experiments which give the drinking age rule find much higher rates of correct answers than with the standard abstract version.
	- **Interpretations:**
		- Making the task more realistic, made the problem a lot easier - *"thematic facilitation effect"*
	- **Some Critics (not actually):**
		- problems like the drinking age rule **change the task** from one of ***indicative logic*** (concerned with truth and falsity) to one of ***deontic logic*** (concerned with obeying rules and regulations)
		- Different theoretical accounts to explain why the deontic version is so much easier:
			1. we acquire and apply **"pragmatic reasoning schemas"** (*Cheng & Holyoak, 1985*):
				- Rules which apply in certain contexts and can be instantiated with the content of a particular problem.
				- *So people might solve the drinking age rule because:
					- They have a permission schema such as:
						- "If an action A is to be taken, then condition C must be filled",
					- which could be instantiated as:
						- A = drinking beer, and
						- C = 18 years or age or older.
					- The schema tells them violations of this rule occur when the action is taken without the precondition being filled*
			2. The use of innate evolved rules for social exchange (*Cosmides, 1989*)
			3. Interpreting the problems as a decision-making task in order to maximise perceived benefits (*Manktelow & Over, 1991*)
			4. The role of pragmatic relevance for different forms of conditional statement (*Sperber, Cara, & Girotto, 1995*).
