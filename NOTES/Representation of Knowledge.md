# Knowledge and Regions of Brain
---

Brain regions involved in **abstraction** of knowledge:
1. **Prefrontal Regions:** *extracting meaningful info* from pictures and sentences.
	- Left Prefrontal: processing of verbal info
	- Right Prefrontal: processing of visual material
2. **Posterior Regions (temporal cortex):** *representation of Categorical Info*


# Memory for Meaningful Interpretations of Events

## Memory for Verbal Information
---

#### Desertation Study by Eric Wanner (1968)

- **Setting & Task:**
	- Listen to Tape-recorded informations
	- Participants divided into 2 groups:
		- G1: received a warning that they will be tested on their ability to recall particular sentences
		- G2: received no such warnings
	- After this the instructions were same for both groups
	- One of the 4 (i, ii, iii, iv) possible critical sentences were presented:
		- pair(i, ii) & pair(iii, iv) - *differ in style* but not in meaning
		- pair(i, iii) & pair(ii, iv) - *differ in meaning* but not in style
		- eg:
			- (i) When you score your results, do nothing to **correct your** answers
			  but **mark carefully** those answers which are wrong
			- (ii) When you score your results, do nothing to **correct your** answers
			  but **carefully mark** those answers which are wrong
			- (iii) When you score your results, do nothing to **your correct** answers
			  but **mark carefully** those answers which are wrong
			- (iv) When you score your results, do nothing to **your correct** answers
			  but **carefully mark** those answers which are wrong
	- On Page 2 they were presented 2 sentences:
		- the critical sentence that they had studied
		- another sentence that differed from the prev. sentence either in style or just in meaning

- **Observations and Implications:**
	- ![[Pasted image 20230329113219.png]]

	1. Memory / accuracy: changes in words that result in changes in {**meaning > style**}
		- indicates that, people normally extract the meaning from a linguistic message
		- Memory for meaning is equally good for G1 and G2 (slight difference is not statistically significant)
	2. G1 (warned group) remembered the *changes in style* almost by 80% accuracy
		- indicates that, people are capable of remembering exact wording if that is their goal

- **Conclusion**
	- Thus, although we do not normally retain much information about exact wording, we can do so when we are cued to pay attention to such information.


## Memory for Visual Information
---

> Our memory for visual information often seems much better than our memory for verbal information

#### Shepard 1967

- **Objective:** *performed one of the early experiments comparing memory for pictures with memory for verbal material*

- **Task:** two types:
	- **T1 - Picture memory task**
		- participants first studied magazine pictures (one-at-a-time)
		- Then, presented with pairs of pictures (one studied one not studied)
		- Asked to identify which they had studied
	- **T2 - Sentence memory task**
		- participants studied sentences (one-at-a-time)
		- Then, presented with pairs of sentences (one studied one not studied)
		- Asked to identify which they had studied

- **Observations**
	- Only 1.5% error on T1 (visual task)
	- About 11% error on T2 (verbal task)

- **Conclusion**
	- memory for verbal information was quite good, but memory for visual information was virtually perfect

#### Brady, Konkle, Alvarez, and Oliva (2008)

- **Task:** Had participants study a set of 2500 images, then identify individual pictures, when paired with similar alternatives.
- **Observations:** 87.5% accuracy

#### Nickerson and Adams (1979)

- **Objective:** people do not always show such good memory for pictures—it depends on the circumstances
- **Task:** Asked Americal students to identify which of the pictures was the "actual US Penny"
- **Observations:** Not able to identify the actual penny (despite having seen it so many times)
- **Conclusions:** It seems that the details of the penny are not something people attend to. In the experiments showing good visual memory, the participants are told to attend to the details.

#### Marmie and Healy (2004)

- **Objective:** Role of attention in memory
- **Task:** Participants examined a novel coin for a minute and then, a week later, were asked to remember the details
- **Observations:** achieved much higher accuracy than in the penny study
- **Conclusions:** Role of attention confirmed

```
How do people actually deploy their attention,
when studying a complex visual scene?
```

#### Mandler and Ritchey (1977)

- **Objective:** Typically, people attend to, and remember, what they consider to be the meaningful or important aspects of the scene
- **Task:**
	- Participants studied pictures of scenes (*like- Classroom*). 8 such pictures for 10 sec.
	- They were then, presented with series of pictures and asked to identify the studied pic.
	- The series included - "studied picture", and "distractor picture"
	- The distractor was of 2 types:
		- **Token distractor:** differed from the target image in a relatively **unimportant** visual detail (eg- pattern of teacher's cloth)
		- **Type distractor:** differed from the target image in a relatively **important** visual detail (eg- what's there on the board - what is being taught)
	- ![[Pasted image 20230329120937.png]]
- **Observations:**
	- Recognized the *original* pic - 70% of the time
	- Rejected *Token distractor*s (unimp. diff.) - only 60% of the time
	- Rejected *Type distractors* (imp. diff.) - 94% of the time
- **Conclusions:**
	- Participants are more sensitive to meaning-significant changes in a picture rather than details details in the picture
	- ***Similar to Wanner** - participant more sensitive to meaning-significant changes in a sentence*


## Importance of Meaning to Memory
---

> What if the material is not meaningful, such as hard-to-follow

#### Bransford and Johnson (1972) - for verbal memory

- **Task:** Participants were divided into 2 groups and asked to read the following passage: 
	- ![[Pasted image 20230329121651.png]]
	- G1: not given any context
	- G2: Told before reading that its about *washing cloths*
	- Later tested for recall
- **Observations:** G1 showed poor recall. In fact, recall(G2) = 2 . recall(G1)

#### Goldstein & Chance (1970) - for visual memory

- **Task:**
	- compared **memory for faces** *versus* **memory for snowflakes**
	- Test for recognition, 48 hours later 
- **Observations:**
	- recognize 74% of faces but only 30% faces
	- (*Even though individual snowflakes are more visually different than individual faces*)
- **Interpretation:**
	- Participants don't know what sense to make of the features in a snowflake.
	- But they are capable of doing so in case of faces

#### Oates & Reder (2010) - visual mem can be poor than verbal mem

- **Title:** "*Sometimes a Picture Is Not Worth a Single Word,”*"
- **Task, Obs, ...**
	- Compared recognition memory for words with recog. mem. for abstract pictures.
	- Found recog. for pictures was quite poor -- about half as that for words.

#### Bower, Karlin, Dueck (1975) - reason for good mem. for picture

- **Study:** Participants studied drawings with or without an explanation of their meaning
- **Test:** Redraw the pictures
- **Observations:**
	- when explanation was given: 70% correctly reconstructed (better recall)
	- when explanation not given: 51% correctly reconstructed
- **Conclusions:**
	- memory for the drawings depended critically on participants’ ability to give them a meaningful interpretation


## Implications of Good Memory for Meaning
---

- When faced with materials to remember, it will they can be given some meaningful interpretation.
- **Applications:**
	- shopping lists, names for faces, telephone numbers, rote facts in a college class, vocabulary items in a foreign language, and so on.
- In all cases, we can improve memory if we associate the items to be remembered with a meaningful interpretation.

**Example:** 
- The association DAX-GIB can be remembered as "Dad" - "Gibberish"
- So I might have created an image of my father speaking some gibberish to me. This would have been a simple **mnemonic (memory-assisting) technique**


# Propositional Representations
---

> We have shown that in many situations people **do not remember exact physical details** of what they have *seen* or *heard* but **rather the “meaning” of what they have encountered**.

- To be more prices about what is meant by "meaning", cognitive psychologists have developed what is called a **propositional representation**
- **Proposition** - smallest unit of knowledge that can stand as a separate assertion (meaningfully judged as T/F)

**Consider the following sentences:**
*We have shown that in many situations people do not remember exact physical details of what they have seen or heard but rather the “meaning” of what they have encountered.*

**The info in above sentence can be communicated by the following simpler sentences:**
A. Lincoln was president of the United States during a war.
B. The war was bitter.
C. Lincoln freed the slaves.

*If any of these simple sentences were false, the complex sentence also would be false*

#### Claims of Propositional Representations

- **Does not claim that**, a person remembers simple sentences like these when encoding the meaning of a complex sentence.
- **Rather it claims that**, the material is encoded in a more abstract way
- *eg- the propositional representation poposed by Kintch 1974*

#### Popositional Representation proposed by Kintch 1974

- Each poposition is rep. as a list containing:
	- **relation**
	- followed by an ordered list of **arguments**
- **Relation:** organize the arguments and typically correspond to
	- verbs (*free*)
	- adjectives (*bitter*)
	- other relational terms (*president of*)
- **Argument:** refer to particular times, places, people, objects, and typically correspond to
	- nouns (*Lincoln, war, slaves*)
- *Example:*
	- A) (president-of: Lincoln, United States, war)
	- B) (bitter: war)
	- C) (free: Lincoln, slaves)

#### Demostration by Bransford and Franks (1971)

- **Objective:** to demostrate the psychological reality of propositional units
- **Study:** participants studied 12 sentences, including the following:
	- ![[Pasted image 20230329150347.png]]
	- The **propositional units** in these sentences come from either of the 2 sets of 4 propositions.
	- ![[Pasted image 20230329150512.png]] ![[Pasted image 20230329150526.png]]
- **Test:** recognition memory was tested for following three kinds of sentences:
	1. Old: actually studied
	   (*The ants in the kitchen ate the jelly*)
	2. New: Not studied but consisted of the propositions that occured in studied sentences
	   (*The ants ate the sweet jelly*)
	3. Noncase: Neither studied nor contains those propositions
	   (*The ants ate the jelly beside the woods*)
- **Observations:**
	- Participants had almost no ability to discriminate between **Old** and **New**, and said they had actually heard either
	- They were however confident that they did not study the **Noncase**.
- **Conslusions:**
	- Although people remember the propositions they encounter, they are quite insensitive to the actual combination of those propositions


## Amodal versus Perceptual Symbol Systems
---

*As per Barsalou,*
1. **Amodal Symbol System** (eg- propositional representations)
	- Elements within the system are inherently non-perceptual.
	- The original stimulus may be a picture or a sentence, but the representation is abstracted away from the verbal or visual modality
	- Given this abstraction, one would predict that participants would be unable to remember the exact words or exact picture.
2. **Perceptual Symbol System** (a hypothesis by Barsalou)
	- Information is represented in terms specific to a particular perceptual modality (visual, auditory, ...)
	- It is an extension of **Paivio's (1971, 1986) dual code theory** which claimed that:
		- info is rep in combined verbal + visual codes
		- *Paivio suggested when we hear a sentence, we also develop a visual image of what it describes. I we later remember only the visual image and not the sentence, we will remember what the sentence was about but not the exact words*
		- Does not predict that which mem for visual will be better than verbal. Depends on the relative attention.

#### Holmes, Waters & Rajaram (1998)

- **Objective:** A replication of Bransford and Franks (1971) study
- **Task:** same as before but in addition participants asked to count the number of letters in the last word of each sentence.
- **Observations:** Increased ability to discriminate sentences studied and not studied but with similar meaning.
- **Interpretations:** counting words increased the attention to the wording.


> But how can an **abstract concept** (such as *honesty*) be represented in a **purely perceptual cognitive system**?

#### Barsalou, Simmons, Barbey, and Wilson (2003)

- *cited evidence that when people understand a sentence, they come up with a perceptual representation of that sentence.* For example: `Stanfield and Zawan (2001)`
- *cited **neuroscience studies** showing that concepts are represented in brain areas similar to those that process perceptions*

#### Stanfield and Zwaan (2001)

- **Study:** Participants read a sentence a sentence about a nail being pounded into either the wall or floor.
- **Test:** They were shown pictures of a nail being pounded either vertically or horizontally. And asked whether the object in the picture had been mentioned in the sentence heard earlier or not.
- **Observations:** Response was quicker when the orientation in the sentence matched with that in the picture.
- **Conclusions:** Thus, their representation of the sentence seemed to contain this perceptual detail


# Embodied Cognition
---

> Barsalou’s perceptual symbol hypothesis is an instance of the growing emphasis in psychology on understanding the contribution of the environment and our bodies to shaping our cognition
> 
> As Thelen (2000) describes the viewpoint:
>
> ![[Pasted image 20230329154438.png]]


**Embodied Cognition** emphasizes the ***contribution of "motor action"*** and how it connects us to the environment

#### Glenberg (2007)

- argues that our understanding of language often depends on convertly acting out what the language describes.
- He points to an *fMRI study*

#### fMRI Study by - Hauk, Johnsrude & Pulvermuller (2004)

- They recorded brain activation while people listened to verbs *like - lick, pick or kick*
- They looked for activity along mortex cortex of various regions *like - face, arm, pick*
- **Obs:** there was greater activation in the part of the mortor cortex that would produce the action.
- ![[Pasted image 20230329160043.png]]

> part of our understanding of someone performing an action is our ability to relate to our own motor system so that we can mimic the action.


#### How info is related between different perceptual and motor modalities

![[Pasted image 20230329155529.png]]

1. **Multimodal Hypothesis:** There are mechanisms for translation between each modality
2. **Amodal Hypothesis:** Each mdality can be translated back and forth to a central meaning representation (which is more abstract).

The amodal hypothesis holds that this information is retained in the central meaning system. The multimodal hypothesis holds that the person has converted the information from the modality of the presentation to some other modality.
