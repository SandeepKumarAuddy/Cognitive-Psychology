# Knowledge and Regions of Brain
---

Brain regions involved in **abstraction** of knowledge:
1. **Prefrontal Regions:** *extracting meaningful info* from pictures and sentences.
	- Left Prefrontal: processing of verbal info
	- Right Prefrontal: processing of visual material
2. **Posterior Regions (temporal cortex):** *representation of Categorical Info*


# Memory for Meaningful Interpretations of Events

## Memory for Verbal Information
---

#### Desertation Study by Eric Wanner (1968)

- **Setting & Task:**
	- Listen to Tape-recorded informations
	- Participants divided into 2 groups:
		- G1: received a warning that they will be tested on their ability to recall particular sentences
		- G2: received no such warnings
	- After this the instructions were same for both groups
	- One of the 4 (i, ii, iii, iv) possible critical sentences were presented:
		- pair(i, ii) & pair(iii, iv) - *differ in style* but not in meaning
		- pair(i, iii) & pair(ii, iv) - *differ in meaning* but not in style
		- eg:
			- (i) When you score your results, do nothing to **correct your** answers
			  but **mark carefully** those answers which are wrong
			- (ii) When you score your results, do nothing to **correct your** answers
			  but **carefully mark** those answers which are wrong
			- (iii) When you score your results, do nothing to **your correct** answers
			  but **mark carefully** those answers which are wrong
			- (iv) When you score your results, do nothing to **your correct** answers
			  but **carefully mark** those answers which are wrong
	- On Page 2 they were presented 2 sentences:
		- the critical sentence that they had studied
		- another sentence that differed from the prev. sentence either in style or just in meaning

- **Observations and Implications:**
	- ![[Pasted image 20230329113219.png]]

	1. Memory / accuracy: changes in words that result in changes in {**meaning > style**}
		- indicates that, people normally extract the meaning from a linguistic message
		- Memory for meaning is equally good for G1 and G2 (slight difference is not statistically significant)
	2. G1 (warned group) remembered the *changes in style* almost by 80% accuracy
		- indicates that, people are capable of remembering exact wording if that is their goal

- **Conclusion**
	- Thus, although we do not normally retain much information about exact wording, we can do so when we are cued to pay attention to such information.


## Memory for Visual Information
---

> Our memory for visual information often seems much better than our memory for verbal information

#### Shepard 1967

- **Objective:** *performed one of the early experiments comparing memory for pictures with memory for verbal material*

- **Task:** two types:
	- **T1 - Picture memory task**
		- participants first studied magazine pictures (one-at-a-time)
		- Then, presented with pairs of pictures (one studied one not studied)
		- Asked to identify which they had studied
	- **T2 - Sentence memory task**
		- participants studied sentences (one-at-a-time)
		- Then, presented with pairs of sentences (one studied one not studied)
		- Asked to identify which they had studied

- **Observations**
	- Only 1.5% error on T1 (visual task)
	- About 11% error on T2 (verbal task)

- **Conclusion**
	- memory for verbal information was quite good, but memory for visual information was virtually perfect

#### Brady, Konkle, Alvarez, and Oliva (2008)

- **Task:** Had participants study a set of 2500 images, then identify individual pictures, when paired with similar alternatives.
- **Observations:** 87.5% accuracy

#### Nickerson and Adams (1979)

- **Objective:** people do not always show such good memory for pictures—it depends on the circumstances
- **Task:** Asked Americal students to identify which of the pictures was the "actual US Penny"
- **Observations:** Not able to identify the actual penny (despite having seen it so many times)
- **Conclusions:** It seems that the details of the penny are not something people attend to. In the experiments showing good visual memory, the participants are told to attend to the details.

#### Marmie and Healy (2004)

- **Objective:** Role of attention in memory
- **Task:** Participants examined a novel coin for a minute and then, a week later, were asked to remember the details
- **Observations:** achieved much higher accuracy than in the penny study
- **Conclusions:** Role of attention confirmed

```
How do people actually deploy their attention,
when studying a complex visual scene?
```

#### Mandler and Ritchey (1977)

- **Objective:** Typically, people attend to, and remember, what they consider to be the meaningful or important aspects of the scene
- **Task:**
	- Participants studied pictures of scenes (*like- Classroom*). 8 such pictures for 10 sec.
	- They were then, presented with series of pictures and asked to identify the studied pic.
	- The series included - "studied picture", and "distractor picture"
	- The distractor was of 2 types:
		- **Token distractor:** differed from the target image in a relatively **unimportant** visual detail (eg- pattern of teacher's cloth)
		- **Type distractor:** differed from the target image in a relatively **important** visual detail (eg- what's there on the board - what is being taught)
	- ![[Pasted image 20230329120937.png]]
- **Observations:**
	- Recognized the *original* pic - 70% of the time
	- Rejected *Token distractor*s (unimp. diff.) - only 60% of the time
	- Rejected *Type distractors* (imp. diff.) - 94% of the time
- **Conclusions:**
	- Participants are more sensitive to meaning-significant changes in a picture rather than details details in the picture
	- ***Similar to Wanner** - participant more sensitive to meaning-significant changes in a sentence*


## Importance of Meaning to Memory
---

> What if the material is not meaningful, such as hard-to-follow

#### Bransford and Johnson (1972) - for verbal memory

- **Task:** Participants were divided into 2 groups and asked to read the following passage: 
	- ![[Pasted image 20230329121651.png]]
	- G1: not given any context
	- G2: Told before reading that its about *washing cloths*
	- Later tested for recall
- **Observations:** G1 showed poor recall. In fact, recall(G2) = 2 . recall(G1)

#### Goldstein & Chance (1970) - for visual memory

- **Task:**
	- compared **memory for faces** *versus* **memory for snowflakes**
	- Test for recognition, 48 hours later 
- **Observations:**
	- recognize 74% of faces but only 30% faces
	- (*Even though individual snowflakes are more visually different than individual faces*)
- **Interpretation:**
	- Participants don't know what sense to make of the features in a snowflake.
	- But they are capable of doing so in case of faces

#### Oates & Reder (2010) - visual mem can be poor than verbal mem

- **Title:** "*Sometimes a Picture Is Not Worth a Single Word,”*"
- **Task, Obs, ...**
	- Compared recognition memory for words with recog. mem. for abstract pictures.
	- Found recog. for pictures was quite poor -- about half as that for words.

#### Bower, Karlin, Dueck (1975) - reason for good mem. for picture

- **Study:** Participants studied drawings with or without an explanation of their meaning
- **Test:** Redraw the pictures
- **Observations:**
	- when explanation was given: 70% correctly reconstructed (better recall)
	- when explanation not given: 51% correctly reconstructed
- **Conclusions:**
	- memory for the drawings depended critically on participants’ ability to give them a meaningful interpretation


## Implications of Good Memory for Meaning
---

- When faced with materials to remember, it will they can be given some meaningful interpretation.
- **Applications:**
	- shopping lists, names for faces, telephone numbers, rote facts in a college class, vocabulary items in a foreign language, and so on.
- In all cases, we can improve memory if we associate the items to be remembered with a meaningful interpretation.

**Example:** 
- The association DAX-GIB can be remembered as "Dad" - "Gibberish"
- So I might have created an image of my father speaking some gibberish to me. This would have been a simple **mnemonic (memory-assisting) technique**


# Propositional Representations
---

> We have shown that in many situations people **do not remember exact physical details** of what they have *seen* or *heard* but **rather the “meaning” of what they have encountered**.

- To be more prices about what is meant by "meaning", cognitive psychologists have developed what is called a **propositional representation**
- **Proposition** - smallest unit of knowledge that can stand as a separate assertion (meaningfully judged as T/F)

**Consider the following sentences:**
*We have shown that in many situations people do not remember exact physical details of what they have seen or heard but rather the “meaning” of what they have encountered.*

**The info in above sentence can be communicated by the following simpler sentences:**
A. Lincoln was president of the United States during a war.
B. The war was bitter.
C. Lincoln freed the slaves.

*If any of these simple sentences were false, the complex sentence also would be false*

#### Claims of Propositional Representations

- **Does not claim that**, a person remembers simple sentences like these when encoding the meaning of a complex sentence.
- **Rather it claims that**, the material is encoded in a more abstract way
- *eg- the propositional representation poposed by Kintch 1974*

#### Popositional Representation proposed by Kintch 1974

- Each poposition is rep. as a list containing:
	- **relation**
	- followed by an ordered list of **arguments**
- **Relation:** organize the arguments and typically correspond to
	- verbs (*free*)
	- adjectives (*bitter*)
	- other relational terms (*president of*)
- **Argument:** refer to particular times, places, people, objects, and typically correspond to
	- nouns (*Lincoln, war, slaves*)
- *Example:*
	- A) (president-of: Lincoln, United States, war)
	- B) (bitter: war)
	- C) (free: Lincoln, slaves)

#### Demostration by Bransford and Franks (1971)

- **Objective:** to demostrate the psychological reality of propositional units
- **Study:** participants studied 12 sentences, including the following:
	- ![[Pasted image 20230329150347.png]]
	- The **propositional units** in these sentences come from either of the 2 sets of 4 propositions.
	- ![[Pasted image 20230329150512.png]] ![[Pasted image 20230329150526.png]]
- **Test:** recognition memory was tested for following three kinds of sentences:
	1. Old: actually studied
	   (*The ants in the kitchen ate the jelly*)
	2. New: Not studied but consisted of the propositions that occured in studied sentences
	   (*The ants ate the sweet jelly*)
	3. Noncase: Neither studied nor contains those propositions
	   (*The ants ate the jelly beside the woods*)
- **Observations:**
	- Participants had almost no ability to discriminate between **Old** and **New**, and said they had actually heard either
	- They were however confident that they did not study the **Noncase**.
- **Conslusions:**
	- Although people remember the propositions they encounter, they are quite insensitive to the actual combination of those propositions


## Amodal versus Perceptual Symbol Systems
---

*As per Barsalou,*
1. **Amodal Symbol System** (eg- propositional representations)
	- Elements within the system are inherently non-perceptual.
	- The original stimulus may be a picture or a sentence, but the representation is abstracted away from the verbal or visual modality
	- Given this abstraction, one would predict that participants would be unable to remember the exact words or exact picture.
2. **Perceptual Symbol System** (a hypothesis by Barsalou)
	- Information is represented in terms specific to a particular perceptual modality (visual, auditory, ...)
	- It is an extension of **Paivio's (1971, 1986) dual code theory** which claimed that:
		- info is rep in combined verbal + visual codes
		- *Paivio suggested when we hear a sentence, we also develop a visual image of what it describes. I we later remember only the visual image and not the sentence, we will remember what the sentence was about but not the exact words*
		- Does not predict that which mem for visual will be better than verbal. Depends on the relative attention.

#### Holmes, Waters & Rajaram (1998)

- **Objective:** A replication of Bransford and Franks (1971) study
- **Task:** same as before but in addition participants asked to count the number of letters in the last word of each sentence.
- **Observations:** Increased ability to discriminate sentences studied and not studied but with similar meaning.
- **Interpretations:** counting words increased the attention to the wording.


> But how can an **abstract concept** (such as *honesty*) be represented in a **purely perceptual cognitive system**?

#### Barsalou, Simmons, Barbey, and Wilson (2003)

- *cited evidence that when people understand a sentence, they come up with a perceptual representation of that sentence.* For example: `Stanfield and Zawan (2001)`
- *cited **neuroscience studies** showing that concepts are represented in brain areas similar to those that process perceptions*

#### Stanfield and Zwaan (2001)

- **Study:** Participants read a sentence a sentence about a nail being pounded into either the wall or floor.
- **Test:** They were shown pictures of a nail being pounded either vertically or horizontally. And asked whether the object in the picture had been mentioned in the sentence heard earlier or not.
- **Observations:** Response was quicker when the orientation in the sentence matched with that in the picture.
- **Conclusions:** Thus, their representation of the sentence seemed to contain this perceptual detail


# Embodied Cognition
---

> Barsalou’s perceptual symbol hypothesis is an instance of the growing emphasis in psychology on understanding the contribution of the environment and our bodies to shaping our cognition
> 
> As Thelen (2000) describes the viewpoint:
>
> ![[Pasted image 20230329154438.png]]


**Embodied Cognition** emphasizes the ***contribution of "motor action"*** and how it connects us to the environment

#### Glenberg (2007)

- argues that our understanding of language often depends on convertly acting out what the language describes.
- He points to an *fMRI study*

#### fMRI Study by - Hauk, Johnsrude & Pulvermuller (2004)

- They recorded brain activation while people listened to verbs *like - lick, pick or kick*
- They looked for activity along mortex cortex of various regions *like - face, arm, pick*
- **Obs:** there was greater activation in the part of the mortor cortex that would produce the action.
- ![[Pasted image 20230329160043.png]]

> part of our understanding of someone performing an action is our ability to relate to our own motor system so that we can mimic the action.


#### How info is related between different perceptual and motor modalities

![[Pasted image 20230329155529.png]]

1. **Multimodal Hypothesis:** There are mechanisms for translation between each modality
2. **Amodal Hypothesis:** Each mdality can be translated back and forth to a central meaning representation (which is more abstract).

The amodal hypothesis holds that this information is retained in the central meaning system. The multimodal hypothesis holds that the person has converted the information from the modality of the presentation to some other modality.


# Conceptual Knowledge
---

> When we look at a picture, we do not see it as a collection of specific objects.
> Rather, we see it as a pic. of a teacher instructing a student on Geography
> Here, *teacher, student, instruction, geography* are examples of categories

- People tend to remember **categorical information** rather than specific details.
- By doing so, we gain the ability to predict.
	- **Example**- If I say "I was licked by a dog". The listener can predict the number of legs, it approx. size and so on.
- The effects of such categorical perceptions can be -ve as well (eg- they can lead to **stereotyping**)

#### Dunning and Sherman (1997)

- **Study:** Participants studied sentences like:
	- Elizabeth was not very surprised upon receiving her math SAT score.
	- Bob was not very surprised upon receiving her math SAT score.
- **Observations:**
	- It is more likely to falsely believe that, they heard "Elizabeth was not very surprised upon receiving her **low** math SAT score."
	- Than it is believe the low score for Bob
- **Interpretation:**
	- The participants stereotype women to be poor in maths.
	- Also, results were similar for both gender participants (though they were not sexist)

Any research on Categorization has focussed on:
- How we form these categories
- How we use them to interpret experiences
- Notations for representing these categories


## (1) Semantic Networks
---

**Quillian (1966)** proposed that people store information about various categories in a network structure.
- Nodes of categories are linked by an **is a** link
- Properties that are true of the categories are associated with them
- Properties that are true for a given category, are also true for all low-level category under it.

![[Pasted image 20230329191611.png]]

#### Collins and Quillian (1969)

- **Objective:** To test the psychological reality of such networks
- **Study:** Participants given some assertions like:
	1. Canaries can sing.
	2. Canaries have feathers.
	3. Canaries have skin
- **Test:**
	- Participants were shown these
	- Along with false assertions, such as “apples have feathers,” (to keep them HONEST)
	- and they had to judge which were true and which were false.
- **Prediction and Explanation:**
	- Info needed to confirm:
		- sent-(1) is directly stored with "canary"
		- sent-(2) requires traversing up the chain by one link to reach "bird"
		- sent-(3) requires traversing up the chain by two links to reach "animal"
	- If our categorical knowledge were structured like the above fig., we would expect the verification time to follow the order: (1) < (2) < (3)
- **Observations:**
	- Indeed the predictions were true. Time taken was 1310, 1380, 1470 ms. respectively.
- **Complications:**
	- *Subsequent research on the retrieval of information from memory has somewhat complicated the conclusions drawn from the initial Collins and Quillian experiment.*
	- Retrieval Time for a fact also depends on **how how often the fact is experienced**
		- Example:
			- (1)"Apples are eaten" (2) "Apples have dark seeds"
			- Although info for (1) might be present in an intermediate concept such as "food". Yet, it is faster to verify it ( sent-1)
	- Hence, it seems that, if a fact about a concept occurs frequently, then it will be stored with that concept, even if it could also be inferred from a more general concept.
- **Conclusions - about organization of facts in semantic memory and their retrieval times**
	1. If a fact about a concept is encountered frequently, it will be stored with that concept even if it could be inferred from a higher order concept.
	2. The more frequently a fact about a concept is encountered, the more strongly that fact will be associated with the concept. Thereby, more readily they can be verified.
	3. Inferring facts that are not directly stored with a concept takes a relatively long time.


## (2) Schemas
---

> **Problem with Semantic Networks:**
> Semantic networks, which just store properties with concepts, cannot capture the nature of our general knowledge about a house, such as its typical size or shape.
> 
> **Rumelhart & Ortony, 1976** proposed a particular way of representing such knowledge that seemed more useful than the semantic network representation. Their rep. structure was called a **"schema"**


**Schemas:** represent categorical knowledge according to a slot structure, in which slots are the attributes that members category possess. However, the actual values of those attributes can be different for different members, but under some constraints specified by the slot.

*Example: (a partial schema of a "House")*
```
{
	"Isa": building,
	"Parts": rooms,
	"Materials": [wood, brick, stone]
	"Function": human dwelling
	"Shape": [rectilinear, triangular]
	"Size": 100–10,000 square feet
}
```

- Values present there are called **default values**. They can be overwritten for specific member
- There is a special attribute **"Isa"**. which points to the *superset*. Unless contradicted, a a concept inherits features of its superset. These *Isa-links* create a **Generalization-Hierarchy**
- Schemas have another type of structure called a **Part-Hierarchy**. Parts of houses, such as *walls* and *rooms*, have their own schema definitions. Wall - {"hasWindows": True}. Thus, using part-hierarcy we can infer that a house has windows.


> Hence, Schemas represent concepts in terms of supersets, parts, and other attribute-value pairs.
> 
> Lets, now discuss the following topics:
> - Psychological Reality of Schemas
> - Degree of Category Membership
> - Event Concepts


### Psychological Reality of Schemas
---

People will infer that an object has the default values for its category, unless they explicitly notice otherwise

#### Brewer and Treyens (1981)

- **Objective:** Effect of schema on memory
- **Task:**
	- 30 Participants were brought individually to a room, and told that it was an office of the exerimenter, and asked to wait there.
	- After 35s, the experimenter returned and took them to a seminar room nearby.
	- There they were asked to write down, what all they saw in the previous room.
- **Observations:**
	- 29/30 recalled - chair, desk, walls (actually present - and default for an office)
	- 8/30 recalled - bulletin board and skull (actually present - but not default for an office)
	- 9/30 recalled - books (not actually present - but default for an office)
- **Conclusion:**
	- person’s memory for the properties of a location is strongly influenced by that person’s default assumptions about what is typically found in the location.


### Degree of Category Membership
---

- One of the important features of schemas is that, they **allow variations** in the objects of the schema.
- Thus, if schemas really encode our knowledge, **we ought to see a shading** from less typical to more typical members of the category.

#### Rosch (1973)

- **Objective:** variations in category membership
- **Task:** asked participants to rate the typicality of various members of a caegory (1- most, 7-least typical)
- **Observations:**  Particpants consistently rated some members as more typical than others.
	- *Example: Birds (Robin > Chicken), Sports (Football > Weight lifting) ...*

#### Rosh (1975)

- **Task:** Particpants to identify the category to which a given pictured object(s) belong.
- **Observations:**  faster to judge a picture as an instance of a category when it presents a typical member of the category.
	- *Example: Robins are seen as birds more rapidly than Chickens* 
- **Conclusions:** Typical members of a category have an advantage in recognition

#### Rosh (1977)

- **Objective:** To demostrate another way in which some members of a category are more typical.
- **Task:**
	- Participants to compose sentence for category names (*such as "bird"*).
	- The category name in those sentences was then replaced with:
		- (1) typical member ("robin"),
		- (2) less typical member ("eagle")
		- (3) peripheral member ("chicken")
	- Then, asked to rate the sensibility of the updated sentences.
- **Observations:**
	- Sensibility Ratings - goodness (1 > 2 > 3)
- **Conclusion:**
	- Results indicate that, when participants wrote the sentences about a given category, they were thinking of typical members of the category


#### McCloskey and Glucksberg (1978)

- **Objective:** To Look at people’s judgments about what were or were not members of various categories
- **Findings:** Although participants did agree on some items, they disagreed on many.
	- 30 agreed that "cancer" is a **disease** and "happiness" is not. But only 16 agreed that "stroke" was a **disease**
	- 30 agreed that "apple" is a **fruit** and "chicken" is not. But only 16 agreed that "pumpkin" was a **fruit**
- **Tested the same participants again after month**
	- Found that many have changed their minds.
- **Conclusions:**
	- disagreement about category boundaries **does not occur just among participants** — people are very **uncertain even within themselves** exactly where the boundaries of a category should be drawn

#### Labov (1973)

- *Which items participants would call cups and which they would not*
- **Setting & Task:**
	- ![[Pasted image 20230329210221.png]]
	- Shown items 1-4 and a 5th item. (increasing width-to-depth ratio)
	- And asked to flag them as Cup or Bowl under 2 conditions:
		- C1 (neutral context): simply presented with pictures of objects
		- C2 (food context): asked to imagine the object being filled with mashed potatoes.
- **Observations:**
	- ![[Pasted image 20230329210730.png]]
	- **C1:** %cup decreasing with relative width. But no clear boundary. Even at 2.5 rel-width, 25% still said cup
	- **C2:** fewer cup responses and more bowl responses.
- **Conslusion:**
	- It seems that, people's classification behaviour (identifying the boundary of category membership) depends:
		1. Not only on: properties of the object
		2. But also on: the context in which the object is presented / imagined



### Event Concepts
---

Similar to objects, events can also have categories:
*Example:*
```
"Going to a Movie" involves: {
	- going to the theatre
	- buying the tickets
	- buying snacks
	- seeing the movie
	- returning from the theatre
}

```
**Schank and Abelson (1977)** proposed versions of event schemas that they called **scripts**, based on their observation that many events involve *stereotypic sequences of actions*

#### Bower, Black, and Turner (1979)

- **Objectives:** To test the psychological reality of the script-notion.
- **Task:** participants were asked to name what they considered the 20 most important events in an episode (such as "going to a resturant").
- **Observations:** with 32 participants, they failed to complete agreement on what these events were. Although considerable consensus were reported.
  ![[Pasted image 20230329213859.png]]
	- Using 73% as a criterion, we find that the stereotypic sequence was sit down, look at menu, order meal, eat food, pay bill, and leave

#### Bower et al. (1979)

- **Objectives:** To show that such action-scripts have a number of effects on memory for stories
- **Study:** participants to study that included some but not all typical events from a script.
- **Test:** 2 types: *Recall* and *Recognition* (in seperate experiments)
- **Observations:**
	- *Recall Test:* tendency to report events that were part of the script but not actually present in the story
	- *Recognition Test:* participants thought they had studied script items which were actually not present in the story.
	- However, participants showed greater tendency to remember (recall or recognize) actual items from the stories, despite the distortions in the direction of general schema

#### Bower et al. (in a yet another experiment)

- **Study:** They read to the participants stories comprising of 12 prototypical actions in an episode; but with 8 of them rearranged
- **Test & Observations:** In recall test, participants showed a strong tendency to put the actions back to their normal order. (50% of the statements were put back)
- **Conslusions:** powerful effect of general schemas on memory for stories.


> New events are encoded with respect to general schemas and that subsequent recall is influenced by the schemas
> 
> But it is not clear that *misrecalling* is the right characterization of such a phenomena
> 
> Scripts server as a valuable basis for filling in missing information and for correcting errors in information
> **Example:** *If storyteller says the paid was check before the meal was ordered, we have some reason to doubt the storyteller*



## (3) Abstraction Theories versus Exemplar Theories
---
