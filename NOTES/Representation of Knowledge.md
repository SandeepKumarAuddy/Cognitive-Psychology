# Knowledge and Regions of Brain
---

Brain regions involved in **abstraction** of knowledge:
1. **Prefrontal Regions:** *extracting meaningful info* from pictures and sentences.
	- Left Prefrontal: processing of verbal info
	- Right Prefrontal: processing of visual material
2. **Posterior Regions (temporal cortex):** *representation of Categorical Info*


# Memory for Meaningful Interpretations of Events

## Memory for Verbal Information
---

#### Desertation Study by Eric Wanner (1968)

- **Setting & Task:**
	- Listen to Tape-recorded informations
	- Participants divided into 2 groups:
		- G1: received a warning that they will be tested on their ability to recall particular sentences
		- G2: received no such warnings
	- After this the instructions were same for both groups
	- One of the 4 (i, ii, iii, iv) possible critical sentences were presented:
		- pair(i, ii) & pair(iii, iv) - *differ in style* but not in meaning
		- pair(i, iii) & pair(ii, iv) - *differ in meaning* but not in style
		- eg:
			- (i) When you score your results, do nothing to **correct your** answers
			  but **mark carefully** those answers which are wrong
			- (ii) When you score your results, do nothing to **correct your** answers
			  but **carefully mark** those answers which are wrong
			- (iii) When you score your results, do nothing to **your correct** answers
			  but **mark carefully** those answers which are wrong
			- (iv) When you score your results, do nothing to **your correct** answers
			  but **carefully mark** those answers which are wrong
	- On Page 2 they were presented 2 sentences:
		- the critical sentence that they had studied
		- another sentence that differed from the prev. sentence either in style or just in meaning

- **Observations and Implications:**
	- ![[Pasted image 20230329113219.png]]

	1. Memory / accuracy: changes in words that result in changes in {**meaning > style**}
		- indicates that, people normally extract the meaning from a linguistic message
		- Memory for meaning is equally good for G1 and G2 (slight difference is not statistically significant)
	2. G1 (warned group) remembered the *changes in style* almost by 80% accuracy
		- indicates that, people are capable of remembering exact wording if that is their goal

- **Conclusion**
	- Thus, although we do not normally retain much information about exact wording, we can do so when we are cued to pay attention to such information.


## Memory for Visual Information
---

> Our memory for visual information often seems much better than our memory for verbal information

#### Shepard 1967

- **Objective:** *performed one of the early experiments comparing memory for pictures with memory for verbal material*

- **Task:** two types:
	- **T1 - Picture memory task**
		- participants first studied magazine pictures (one-at-a-time)
		- Then, presented with pairs of pictures (one studied one not studied)
		- Asked to identify which they had studied
	- **T2 - Sentence memory task**
		- participants studied sentences (one-at-a-time)
		- Then, presented with pairs of sentences (one studied one not studied)
		- Asked to identify which they had studied

- **Observations**
	- Only 1.5% error on T1 (visual task)
	- About 11% error on T2 (verbal task)

- **Conclusion**
	- memory for verbal information was quite good, but memory for visual information was virtually perfect

#### Brady, Konkle, Alvarez, and Oliva (2008)

- **Task:** Had participants study a set of 2500 images, then identify individual pictures, when paired with similar alternatives.
- **Observations:** 87.5% accuracy

#### Nickerson and Adams (1979)

- **Objective:** people do not always show such good memory for pictures—it depends on the circumstances
- **Task:** Asked Americal students to identify which of the pictures was the "actual US Penny"
- **Observations:** Not able to identify the actual penny (despite having seen it so many times)
- **Conclusions:** It seems that the details of the penny are not something people attend to. In the experiments showing good visual memory, the participants are told to attend to the details.

#### Marmie and Healy (2004)

- **Objective:** Role of attention in memory
- **Task:** Participants examined a novel coin for a minute and then, a week later, were asked to remember the details
- **Observations:** achieved much higher accuracy than in the penny study
- **Conclusions:** Role of attention confirmed

```
How do people actually deploy their attention,
when studying a complex visual scene?
```

#### Mandler and Ritchey (1977)

- **Objective:** Typically, people attend to, and remember, what they consider to be the meaningful or important aspects of the scene
- **Task:**
	- Participants studied pictures of scenes (*like- Classroom*). 8 such pictures for 10 sec.
	- They were then, presented with series of pictures and asked to identify the studied pic.
	- The series included - "studied picture", and "distractor picture"
	- The distractor was of 2 types:
		- **Token distractor:** differed from the target image in a relatively **unimportant** visual detail (eg- pattern of teacher's cloth)
		- **Type distractor:** differed from the target image in a relatively **important** visual detail (eg- what's there on the board - what is being taught)
	- ![[Pasted image 20230329120937.png]]
- **Observations:**
	- Recognized the *original* pic - 70% of the time
	- Rejected *Token distractor*s (unimp. diff.) - only 60% of the time
	- Rejected *Type distractors* (imp. diff.) - 94% of the time
- **Conclusions:**
	- Participants are more sensitive to meaning-significant changes in a picture rather than details details in the picture
	- ***Similar to Wanner** - participant more sensitive to meaning-significant changes in a sentence*


## Importance of Meaning to Memory
---

> What if the material is not meaningful, such as hard-to-follow

#### Bransford and Johnson (1972) - for verbal memory

- **Task:** Participants were divided into 2 groups and asked to read the following passage: 
	- ![[Pasted image 20230329121651.png]]
	- G1: not given any context
	- G2: Told before reading that its about *washing cloths*
	- Later tested for recall
- **Observations:** G1 showed poor recall. In fact, recall(G2) = 2 . recall(G1)

#### Goldstein & Chance (1970) - for visual memory

- **Task:**
	- compared **memory for faces** *versus* **memory for snowflakes**
	- Test for recognition, 48 hours later 
- **Observations:**
	- recognize 74% of faces but only 30% faces
	- (*Even though individual snowflakes are more visually different than individual faces*)
- **Interpretation:**
	- Participants don't know what sense to make of the features in a snowflake.
	- But they are capable of doing so in case of faces

#### Oates & Reder (2010) - visual mem can be poor than verbal mem

- **Title:** "*Sometimes a Picture Is Not Worth a Single Word,”*"
- **Task, Obs, ...**
	- Compared recognition memory for words with recog. mem. for abstract pictures.
	- Found recog. for pictures was quite poor -- about half as that for words.

#### Bower, Karlin, Dueck (1975) - reason for good mem. for picture

- **Study:** Participants studied drawings with or without an explanation of their meaning
- **Test:** Redraw the pictures
- **Observations:**
	- when explanation was given: 70% correctly reconstructed (better recall)
	- when explanation not given: 51% correctly reconstructed
- **Conclusions:**
	- memory for the drawings depended critically on participants’ ability to give them a meaningful interpretation


## Implications of Good Memory for Meaning
---

- When faced with materials to remember, it will they can be given some meaningful interpretation.
- **Applications:**
	- shopping lists, names for faces, telephone numbers, rote facts in a college class, vocabulary items in a foreign language, and so on.
- In all cases, we can improve memory if we associate the items to be remembered with a meaningful interpretation.

**Example:** 
- The association DAX-GIB can be remembered as "Dad" - "Gibberish"
- So I might have created an image of my father speaking some gibberish to me. This would have been a simple **mnemonic (memory-assisting) technique**


# Propositional Representations
---

> We have shown that in many situations people **do not remember exact physical details** of what they have *seen* or *heard* but **rather the “meaning” of what they have encountered**.

- To be more prices about what is meant by "meaning", cognitive psychologists have developed what is called a **propositional representation**
- **Proposition** - smallest unit of knowledge that can stand as a separate assertion (meaningfully judged as T/F)

**Consider the following sentences:**
*We have shown that in many situations people do not remember exact physical details of what they have seen or heard but rather the “meaning” of what they have encountered.*

**The info in above sentence can be communicated by the following simpler sentences:**
A. Lincoln was president of the United States during a war.
B. The war was bitter.
C. Lincoln freed the slaves.

*If any of these simple sentences were false, the complex sentence also would be false*

#### Claims of Propositional Representations

- **Does not claim that**, a person remembers simple sentences like these when encoding the meaning of a complex sentence.
- **Rather it claims that**, the material is encoded in a more abstract way
- *eg- the propositional representation poposed by Kintch 1974*

#### Popositional Representation proposed by Kintch 1974

- Each poposition is rep. as a list containing:
	- **relation**
	- followed by an ordered list of **arguments**
- **Relation:** organize the arguments and typically correspond to
	- verbs (*free*)
	- adjectives (*bitter*)
	- other relational terms (*president of*)
- **Argument:** refer to particular times, places, people, objects, and typically correspond to
	- nouns (*Lincoln, war, slaves*)
- *Example:*
	- A) (president-of: Lincoln, United States, war)
	- B) (bitter: war)
	- C) (free: Lincoln, slaves)

#### Demostration by Bransford and Franks (1971)

- **Objective:** to demostrate the psychological reality of propositional units
- **Task:**
