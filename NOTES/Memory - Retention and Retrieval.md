# Are memories really Forgetting?
---


The **temporal region** (particularly the ***hippocampal region***) play role in **retention** of memory

> Experiments:
> 
> **Penfield (1959)**
> - electrial stimulation to recall forgotten mem.
> - discounted
> 
> **Nelson (1971)**
> - paired assosiates (changed, unchanged)
> 
> **J. D. Johnson, McDuff, Rugg, and Norman (2009)**
> - brain imagin study

### Penfield 1959

- Stimulated portions of patients brain and asked participants what they felt
- This way he understood fxns of various parts of brain
- **Observations:** Stimulations to temporal lobes led participants to recall memories (which they were unable during normal recall)
- **Conclusion:** This means, much of what seems forgotten is still stored in memory
- **Ctritics:** participants reports may not be accurate (since no way to verify it).

### Nelson 1971

##### Task:
- Learn a list of 20 paired associates (num-noun). Studies and tested until recall with no error
- After 2 weeks again tested (75% recall 25% forgot)
- Given new trials with 2 types of pairs: **num-noun_same** or **num-noun_changed**
- Again tested on the new list

##### Observations:
- Of the formely missed items: 78% of unchanged (same) items recalled while only 43% of changed items recalled.

##### Conclusion:
- This large advantage in for unchanged items => some mem. of so called forgotten items were retained in the memory

### J. D. Johnson, McDuff, Rugg, and Norman (2009)

##### Task:

- Participants saw a list of words and for each word they were asked to either
	1. imagine how an artist would draw the object denoted by the word, or
	2. imagine functional uses for the object
- Participants were shown the words again and the classifier was applied to the brain activation patterns.

##### Observations:

- Classifier was able to recognise (with better than chance accuracy) from the patterns, what task the word had been assigned to.
- It was successful both for recalled and forgotten words

##### Conclusion:

- Even though we may have no conscious memory of seeing something, aspects of how we experienced it will be retained in our brains


# The Retention Function
---


>The strength of a memory trace decays as a power function of the retention interval
>
>**Decay Theory of forgetting**:
> - memory traces simply decay in strength with time.
> - one of the common explanations of forgetting.
> 
> **Interference Theory:**
> - in next `section`


### Recognition Experiment (Wickelgren, 1975)

- Participants presented with a seq of words to study
- Examined the probability of their recognition (d') after delays (T) from 1 min - 14 days.
- d' = c.T^(-b)
- log(d') = A - b.log(T)
- where, A = log(c)
- ![[Pasted image 20230221224331.png]]
- The memory loss is "negatively accelerated" - the rate of change gets smaller and smaller as the delay increases

> ***Wixted and Ebbesen (1991***) concluded that "retention functions are generally power function"
> The relationship is called **Power Law of Forgetting**


### Bahrick 1984

extensive investigation on "negative accelaration"

Collected data on Participants retention of English-Spanish vocabulary items delay (immeditely to 50 years since learning)

Data shows:
1. Slow decay of knowledge - with substantial "practise effect" (more num of courses => more recall)
2. nearly flat between 3-25 years - as expected by a power fxn
3. further drop-off between 25-49 years - probably due to physiological deterioration in old age

### Raymond and Redman 2006

explanations for the retention functions - maybe found in underlying neural process

**Long-term potentiation (LTP)** - an increase in neural responsiveness due to prior electrical stimulation

Conducted an experiment on rats:

##### Task:
- Plotted there are three conditions:
	1. a control condition - no stimulation,
	2. single stimulation to induce LTP, and
	3. 8 such stimulations

##### Observations:
- Observe the decrease in LTP in the rat hippocampus with delay
- level of LTP is greater in the condition with eight stimulations than in the condition with one (a learning effect), both conditions show a drop-off with delay

# How Interference Affects Memory
---


> Retention strongly impacted by (not only delay, but also) interfering material

### Experiments on interference

###### Task:
- Participants divided into 2 groups - Experimental group and Control Group - and made to learn paired associates
- After learning both the lists, both the groups are tested after considerable delay (24 hrs - 1 week)

![[Pasted image 20230221230619.png]]

##### Observations:
- Experimental group performs worse than Control group

##### Conclusion:
- Evidence that learning the A–D list interferes with retention of the A–B list and causes it to be forgotten more rapidly

```

It is harder to maintain multiple associations for the same item

=> (1) diff to learn new assos to these items
   (2) diff to retain old assos once the new assos are learned

=> It seems, learning new info about a concept is poor for memory

But, Fortunately 
----> Some important additional factors ("redundancy") counteract "interference"

```

## Fan Effect
---

more facts (Fi) associated with a concept (C), slower is the retrieval of any one of the facts

### Study by JR Anderson 1974

Partipants asked to memorize 26 sentences of the form "\<person\> is in a \<location\>"
Example:
1. The doctor is in the bank. (1-1)
2. The fireman is in the park. (1-2)
3. The lawyer is in the church. (2-1)
4. The lawyer is in the park. (2-2)

They were then tested on test sentences (consisting of original sentences and re-pairing people-location from study set) and asked to recognize if the sentences were from study set or not.

**Observations:** Recognition (measured in terms of recognition time) was:
- best for (1);
- good for (2) and (3);
- poor for (4)

**Explanations:**

- ![[Pasted image 20230221233151.png]]
- The ovals represented **mem struct** of the sentences.
- **Source concepts** are the set of persons P = {Doctor, Lawyer, Fireman} and set of locations L = {Bank, Church, Park}
- Each source concept has a **limited total activation** that can spread to the associated sentences
- Therefore, more spreading from a concept => lesser is the activation received by the associated sentences
- And, recognition time for a sentence is *inversely proportional* to activation level of its memory structure

### Study, Sohn, Goode, Stenger, Carter, and Anderson (2003)

fMRI brain-imaging study - response in the prefrontal-cortex during such tasks
**Observations:** High-Fan sentence show greater hemodynamic response, since more work is done by the prefrontal structures for retireval.

## Interfering Effect of Pre-existing Memories
---

Do such interference effects (fan-effect) occur with material learned outside of the laboratory

### Lewis and Anderson 1976

#### Task:

- Learn fantasy facts about public figures (eg- Nepolian was from india)
- Subjects studied 0-4 such fantasy facts
- Then the were tested on 3 types of sentences:
	1. studied in the exp (**Exp True**)
	2. true fact about the public figure (**Act True**)
	3. false in both exp and truely (**False**)
- And asked to reply TRUE for cases:(1) and (2) and FALSE for case:3

#### Observation:

- Reaction time decreased with num of fantasy facts
- This happened not only for (1) but also for (2)
- However, overall recognition time (for a given fan-in) followed the order: 
	  False < ExpTrue < ActTrue
- ExpTrue < ActTrue ... REASON: actual facts are more strongly encoded in memory than the fantasy facts

#### Conclusion:

- Material learned in the laboratory can interfere with material learned outside of the laboratory as well

## Controversy over Interference and Delay
---

**Speculation against Decay Theory:**

- CLAIM: Memories appear to decay during the retention period due to constant interference with additional memories.
- So lets check whether retention is better during sleep (since, at that time there is no/min. intrference)
- **Ekstrand (1972)** reviewed a great deal of research **consistent with the conclusion** that less is forgotten during the period of sleep.

**Arguments the speculations:**

- However, it appears that critical variable is not sleep, but time of day
- **Hockey, Davies, and Gray (1972)** found that participants in general better remembered material that they learned at night, even if they were kept up during the night and slept during the day. REASON: most UG participants are highly aroused during early evening, and retention is better in a high-arousal state

**Drawbacks of Decay Theory:**

- only consider time as a factor for forgetting, and does not consider psychological effects

However, it may be possible that there is no purely psychological level explanation to forgetting. Explanations maybe only physiological (eg- LTP data)

**Conclusion:**

- Dono ("decay" & "interference") sahi hai bhai

## An inhibitory explanation of Forgetting?
---

> Interference Effects are due to an "**inhibition-process**" that actively suppresses competing memories, rather than a passive side-effect of storing memories
>
> It has been argued that forgetting may also be produced by **active suppression of memories**, but the evidence is inclusive.

### M. C. Anderson & Spellman, 1995

**Task:**

- Participants given a list of "category-exemplar" pairs (there can be mult. instances of a given category)
- Intial Study of all the pairs
- Practice on only some of the pairs.
- Recall Tes: given cat name recall all the items assosciated to it

**Observations:**

- ![[Pasted image 20230222002550.png]]
- red-blood has good recall due to practise
- red-tomato has poor recall: can be also explained with other interfering theories (eg- competition from red-blood)
- food-strawberry has poor recall: .........???....... (was not even categorized as red)

**Explanation:**

 - while practicing red-blood, participants were inhibiting all other items which were red (tomato, strawberry)

### M. C. Anderson & Green, 2001

think / no-think paradigm

---- fake reports ---

retireval induced suppression


## Redundancy Protects against Interference
---

> Interference only occurs when multiple pieces of information have no intrinsic relationship to one another.
>
> It does not occur if the info are meaningfully related.

### Bradshaw and Anderson 1982

**Task:**

- Participants learned under 3 conditions:
	1. (single condition) : Target fact
	2. (irrelev condition) : Target fact + 2 unrelated facts
	3. (relev conditions) : Target fact + 2 facts causally related to target fact
- Tested for **ability to remember target fact** given the name of the person:
	- immediately
	- after a week

**Observations:**

![[Pasted image 20230222004336.png]]
- Here, comp: (single, irrelev) -> standard interference effect
- But, comp: (single, relev) - after a week's time -> relev% is better

**Explanations:**

 - Recall was better even when more facts were learned, but it was so because the facts were causally related to the target fact
