# Psychology of Thinking

> Taken from **Class PPT** (just before *Problem Solving*)

"I think therefore I am" - *Rene Descartes*

**Definition of Thinking:**

- Cognitive Rearrangment or manipulation of external (environment) and internal (memory) information.
- *Example:* "How will I look if I wear this shirt?"

**Types of thinking:**

- Unfocussed: "Aaj kya khayenge?"
- Focussed: "Maths Problem..."

**We think via?**

- Information used in thinking are often called **symbols**
- Most symbols used in thinking are in the form of **language**

**Categories of Thinking**

1. **Problem Solving:** "I thinking how to do this home assignment..."
2. **Reasoning (Deductive | Inductive):** "I think there is no lecture today. No one has turned up in class..."
3. **Decision Making (and Judgement):** "I am thinking about which phone would be best for me..."

# Primer on Thinking

> Taken from Reading: [[thinking_primer.pdf]]

- **Thought / Idea** can be of the 2 forms:
	- **Concept**
		- image/idea without any claim
		- Occurs as words, phrases, non-informative sentences
	- **Affirmation** 
		- Assent / Proposition that claims something
		- Occurs as complete sentences, where one concept is predicated to another
- Also Concepts and Afffirmations (in general Thought / Idea) can be either:
	- Simple
		- understood without inferences
		- require no proof or explanation
	- Complex
		- require inferences
		- require proof or explanation utilizing simple ideas

#### Thoughts / Ideas as Sentences

1. Informative
	- information is being conveyed
	- **can be verified as T/F**
	- Eg- "She is in the class"
2. Non-informative
	- No information is being conveyed
	- **cannot be verified as T/F**
	- Eg- requests, questions, call outs, hope, exclamations

#### Terminologies (Language | Cognition | Logic)

#### Arguments v/s Explanations

- **Argument:**
	- Given some facts, you are predicting (convincing/persuading) what can these facts imply
	- Comprises of evidences
	- Eg- "I he falls on the stairs, he will break his legs"
- **Explanation:**
	- Something has happened, you are trying to use backward inference to fit reasons which might have caused this effect. You are clarifying something.
	- Comprises of facts and consequences
	- Eg- "His leg is broken as he fell on the stairs"

Everyday (Conf)USE

**"This dog might be injured, because he got in a fight"**

- cannot determine whether it is an argument or an explanation
- Depends on the context
	1. Context-1: **The owner of the dog has just watched it fight with another dog. The dog does not seem injured.** --> Argument
	2. Context-2: **The owner of the dog has not seen the dog for a few hours. It comes to the owner hurt and crying** --> Explanation

#### Parts of an Argument

All MEN are MORTAL
SOCRATES is a MAN
Therefore, SOCRATES is MORTAL

Argument = 2 premise + 1 conclusion

There are 3 types of Terms:
1. **Major Term:** present in the predicate (after the verb) of the conclusion ("MORTAL")
2. **Minor Term:** present in the subject of the conclusion ("SOCRATES")
3. **Middle Term:** not present in the conclusion ("MAN" / "MEN")

There are 2 types of Premise:
1. **Major Premise:** that which contains the major term ("All MEN are MORTAL")
2. **Minor Premise:** that which contains the minor term ("SOCRATES is a MAN")
